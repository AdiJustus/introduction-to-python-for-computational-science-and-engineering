- [X] Check figures at end of chapter 15 (MayaVi, vpython) - they don't show up in html output
- [ ] check that saving notebooks without output (15, 16, 17) works fine with binder
- [ ] check binder once merged
- [ ] move footnotes from end of text into the right places
- [ ] in output from pdflatex, one cannot see which cells are input cells and which are output cells.
  - similar in html
  - maybe this works: output is printed in black, input is generally coloured?
    - [ ] Update text where it explains input and output cells (search for "In")
- test CI locally


- [ ] html output on https://fangohr.github.io/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering
  - [ ] add links in the right places
