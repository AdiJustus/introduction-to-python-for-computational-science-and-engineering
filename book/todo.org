- Check figures at end of chapter 15 (MayaVi, vpython) - they don't show up in html output
- check saving notebooks without output (15, 16, 17) works fine with binder
- make binder work
- move footnotes from end of text into the right places
- in output from pdflatex, one cannot see which cells are input cells and which are output cells.
- test CI locally


- html output on https://fangohr.github.io/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering
  - add links in the right places
  - only run this when we merge to master
    - create preview in https://fangohr.github.io/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/dev or so for other branches

- tidy up Makefiles
  - allow execution in docker container locally as used to be?
