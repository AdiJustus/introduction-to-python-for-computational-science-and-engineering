An introduction to Python for Computational Science and
Engineering, developed by Hans Fangohr (2003-2017 University of Southampton)

The book is available as

- html
- [pdf](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/raw/master/pdf/Introduction-to-Python-for-Computational-Science-and-Engineering.pdf)
- downloadable Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`)

It might be easiest to [download this zip file](https://github.com/fangohr/introduction-to-python-for-computational-science-and-engineering/archive/master.zip) that contains all notebooks, and the html and the pdf in the corresponding subdirectors.


The book is based on Python 3.

(A Python 2.7 version
is
[available online](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr/training/python/pdfs/Python2-for-Computational-Science-and-Engineering.pdf))
