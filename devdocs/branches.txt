master:
- libraries in requirements.txt fixed to particular version
- pdf file created correctly
- but binder failes

library-current-versions:
- like master, but
- requirements.txt has most recent version
- I hope this works for binder, and in the future becomes the master
  (when the nbconvert bug is fixed).
