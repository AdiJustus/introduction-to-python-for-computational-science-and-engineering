This repository uses a Dockerfile in the root directory for development
purposes. This includes translation of the source files (in book/*ipynb) to html
and pdf (using jupyterbook), which in turns needs a full latex installation.

That makes the container quite big.

For myBinder, we do not need latex, so in this directory, we attempt to have a
leaner definition of dependencies.

Binder should look in this diretory (as it is called 'binder') and ignore the
global Dockerfile.

I don't know if myBinder could read dependencies from a pyproject.toml file (and
couldn't find any documentation on this yet), nor if we can extract a
requirements.txt file from the pyproject.toml file automatically.

As a first step towards making the binder image leaner, I will stick to a definition via a Dockerfile, and leave out latex to make it smaller.

The general strategy will be to copy from ../Dockerfile, and comment out
unneeded bits and pieces.
